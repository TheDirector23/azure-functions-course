**Let’s wrap up what you learned and did in Week 1: downloading and using Visual Studio Code, learning to navigate GitHub and committing changes, and deploying a simple Azure function.**
<br><br/>

Visual Studio Code (or VS code) was downloaded from this link: https://code.visualstudio.com

Inside VS code, you downloaded four extensions: Azure Account, Azure App Service, Azure Functions, and Live Server. All of the Azure extensions allow you to work on your Azure Function App in VS code instead of working directly through the Microsoft portal. Live Server is a quick and temporary testing server, and you can use it to test HTML pages.

For the GitHub portion of the week, there are two core things to remember: **repositories and committing changes.**

Repositories (or repos) are essentially folders where you can store files of code. The repo of our learning lab was duplicated into your profile when you enrolled in the course so that you can commit changes and complete each lesson.

For our learning lab, each lesson is placed inside an issue. Only when you complete the lesson (committing the necessary code), will the issue close and you can move on to the next issue. Don’t worry – committing changes is easier than it sounds.

Here are the steps to cloning and committing changes to the learning lab repo (through GitHub desktop):

1. Download GitHub desktop. It is here you commit changes to the learning lab to complete each lesson.
2. To have access to the learning lab on GitHub desktop, the name of the learning lab repo needs to be entered in the top-left corner in the box with placeholder “Filter” and “Clone Repository” should be selected.
3. Click “Pull Origin” once the repo is cloned to pull to desktop the most current version of the learning lab.
4. Open VS code by clicking the button “Open in Visual Studio Code”. The files in the learning lab will be opened in VS code, and now you can complete the lesson (adding the necessary code). When you are done making changes in VS code, save the file and return to GitHub desktop.
5. The change will be shown. Add a summary and description of your change and then click “Commit to main”. Next, click “Push origin”, to push the change made in VS code to the website.

*Remember, each step and lesson is posted on the repo on github.com. You will commit changes when the lesson instructs you to, and once you click “Push origin” and refresh the GitHub page, the issue will close and you can move on.*

You don’t have to commit changes on GitHub desktop, though.

Here are the steps to committing code on the GitHub website:

1. In the learning lab repo, there should be a button labeled “Add file” – click it.
2. Click the dropdown option “Create new file”.
3. You can add your code there, and when you are finished, you can click “Commit new file”
4. If you click the second dropdown option under the “Add file” button (“Upload files”), you can upload a file from VS code that is saved in your computer.

Deploying an Azure Function was the biggest task of the week.

Here are the steps:

1. Click “Create a resource” in your portal (near the top left of the screen)
2. Choose “Function App” (it should be in the list of popular resources, with the lightning logo)
3. Create a new resource group, with a unique resource name (make it relevant to what the app does). Add a unique Function App name as well.
4. Make sure the "Code" button is selected next to Publish, the Runtime stack is Node.js, and the Version selected is 12 LTS
5. Select your region
6. All of the other taps in this step should be correctly filled (you can double-check them if you want), so you should be ready to click “Create”
7. Deploying may take a few minutes – be patient!
8. Once the function is deployed, open it and go to the “Functions” tap on the left (with symbol {fx}).
9. Click “Add” on this page, and then “HTTP trigger” (in the side window that opens)
10. Click “Add” (at the bottom of the side window) – creating this HTTP trigger may take a few seconds, so remember: patience!
11. Once this trigger is created, it should open automatically. Click the “Code + Test” tab on the left side, and the code should open.
12. If you need to review the code we created, review the livestream.
13. Click “Save” and “Refresh” (in that order, and refresh only once the trigger has completely saved) once you have finished writing your code (or in between – it never hurts).
14. Click “Test/Run” once you are ready to try out your new trigger function. If it all works smoothly, and the code has no errors, you should receive the correct time based on the information inputted!
<br><br/>

**One more tip: don’t forget to save! Rewriting code can be challenging and extremely frustrating, so save yourself the trouble!**
<br><br/>

That’s about it – see you in Week 2!

**To move on, close this issue.**
